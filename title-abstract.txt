Title:
Servicechain.io: Empowering Service Workers in Web3

Abstract:
In today’s digital environment, building a credible professional reputation does not have many infallible platforms or applications. Especially in the service industry, it is hard to quantify tips, customer sentiment, and experience to carry on in a professional future. We created a user-friendly interface using a QR code integration to easily, digitally tip and rate using ethereum currency. We also created interactive timesheets for employees to enter hours worked. For the future, the usage of the blockchain’s graph structure and timestamping attribute will allow us to easily query data and build a visualization dashboard for employees to view their rating, tipping, and work hour history and patterns. With the use of blockchain technology’s immutable nature, network timestamps, and persistence based chaining, Servicechain.io presents a solution that can enforce a transparent and credible reputation as an employee. Our chain provides functionalities like tipping and rating on a scale of 1-5 for customers to leave honest feedback for service workers, as well as a segmentation to allow individual actors(companies) to create their respective contracts for their employees. Servicechain.io uses smart contracts to house core logic that interacts with the ethereum blockchain. In addition to the smart contract the app provides user-friendly mappings of names to the public hashes of users/organizations through a firebase backend. The usage of the blockchain’s graph structure and timestamping attribute allows us to easily query data and build a visualization for employees to view their rating, tipping, and work hour history and patterns. For the future, the accruing of data points such as hours or tips will allow for the addition of NFT based goodwill rewards incentivizing higher service ratings.
